"""A class to update a dump created by CMS.

Used by DumpImporter and DumpUpdater.

This version adds the Attendance table but it doesn't require any data
migration since it's a new table with no existing data.
It also adds the starting_ip_addresses field to the Participation table
for tracking IP addresses used during contest participation.
